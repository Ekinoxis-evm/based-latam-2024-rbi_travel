# Rbitravel - RV Rentals with USDC on Base
We are providing travelers with a unique and convenient way to rent private RVs in airports using USDC. 

Each RV is tokenized as an NFT, which users can purchase to gain access to the RV during their rental period. This NFT serves as a secure, verifiable key that guarantees access to the RV upon arrival, turning waiting time into a comfortable and private experience.

By combining the power of USDC and blockchain technology, RVPay ensures a smooth, transparent, and secure rental process. Travelers can enjoy the luxury of their own private space while at the airport, whether they need a place to rest, work, or relax. 

The use of NFTs ensures that each rental is uniquely tied to the user, offering both ownership and proof of access to their rented RV.
